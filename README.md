## File Overview

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your website does and how you built it. 

### ← index.html

HTML files are for content! Add your text, images, buttons, and more using HTML tags.

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. 

### ← script.js

JavaScript files add interactivity to your website using code. This is where you can listen for events, then take an action.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project. You do not need to add anything to this folder unless you are working on the extensions. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg`.
